# Usage

### How to compile and run?
    1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
    2. Compile the code by running the command: javac filename.java. This will generate a bytecode file named filename.class.
    3. Run the program by executing the command: java filename. You should see the output after this.

### And the interpretation?
 In Java, the code is compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Therefore, you don't need to explicitly invoke an interpreter to run a Java program.
 So, while you do compile the Java code, the interpretation and execution are handled by the JVM during runtime.
