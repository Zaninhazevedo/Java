# Information to get started

### Concepts

Firstly, the following line of code will be examined.
```java
public class J0TextMessage {
```
#### J0TextMessage
    It is the name of the class being defined. In this case, the class is named "J0TextMessage".
    The file must have the name J0TextMessage.java!
    
#### Class
    It is a keyword used to declare the start of a class definition.

#### Public or Private?
    It is an access modifier that denotes the visibility of the method. In this case, the main method is declared as 
    public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere.
    This concept is further explored in J9.

Now this line will be analyzed.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```

#### Static
    It is a keyword that indicates that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. 
    The main method is declared as static so that it can be invoked without creating an instance of the class.

#### Void 
    It is the return type of the method, indicating that the main method does not return any value.

#### Main
    It is the name of the method. The main method is a special method in Java that serves as the entry point for a 
    Java program. It is the method that is executed when the program starts.

#### (String[] args)
    It is the parameter list of the main method. In this case, it takes a single parameter, which is an array of 
    strings named args. This parameter allows you to pass command-line arguments to the Java program.

Only this line remains to be analyzed.
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

#### System 
    This refers to the System class in Java, which is a predefined class that provides access to system resources 
    and functionalities.

#### out 
    It is a static member of the System class, which represents the standard output stream. It is an instance of 
    the PrintStream class. In a very concise manner, it means that an output will be generated.

#### println() 
    println() is a method of the PrintStream class that is used to print a string or other values to the standard 
    output. It adds a newline character after printing the provided content. Basically, it prints a text message.

#### print()
    If one were to use only print() instead of println(), the same effect would be produced, except for the lack 
    of a line break.

#### "Hello World!"
    This is the string literal enclosed in double quotation marks. It is the content that will be printed to the 
    standard output.

#### Curiosity
    
    In this context, why is it mandatory for the file to be named J0TextMessage?

    In Java, the naming convention that the file name should match the public class name serves as a way to 
    organize and structure your code. It helps maintain consistency and clarity in the codebase.
    When the Java compiler encounters a file with a public class, it expects the file name to match the name of
    that class. This convention makes it easier to locate and identify the class within a project. It also helps
    prevent naming conflicts and confusion when multiple classes are present in a codebase.
    By adhering to this naming convention, it becomes easier for developers to navigate and understand the code. 
    It promotes maintainability and readability, making it simpler for others (including yourself) to work with 
    and modify the code in the future.
    While it is not strictly required by the Java language itself, following this convention is considered a best 
    practice in the Java community. It helps create a standard and consistent structure for Java projects.
