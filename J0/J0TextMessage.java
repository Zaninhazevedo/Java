/*
What I have gleaned is as follows:

- Line 1: 
This line declares a public class named "textmessage". In Java, a class is a blueprint 
for creating objects. The name of the class must match the name of the file in which it 
is defined (in this case, "textmessage.java").

- Line 2: 
This line declares a public static method called "main". In Java, the "main" method 
serves as the entry point of the program. It is the method that is executed when you 
run the program. The method takes an array of strings called "args" as a parameter. 
These arguments can be passed to the program when running it from the command line, 
but in this case, they are not used.

- Line 3:
This line uses the "System.out.println()" statement to print the text "Hello World!" to
the console. The "System.out" refers to the standard output, and "println()" is a 
method that prints a line of text. In this case, it prints the string "Hello World!".
